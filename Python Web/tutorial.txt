        <h4>Basic info:</h4>
        <p>I will be using Visual Studio Code by Microsoft and I suggest using it because it is easier to code with because it has many QoL features, you can download it <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" ;="">here</a>. I will also use comments to show where to put code, they are displayed by hashtags.</p>


        <p>Many basic commands are required to be used to make anything functional, including if-then statements, input, variables, and knowledge of basic math.</p>

        <p>Python reads all code from left to right, top to bottom, just like a human. So, what this means is that you must declare all variables before trying to use them.</p>

        <p style="color:red">✖</p>

        <pre>      print(var1)        
      var1 = “red”
      <p style="color:#00ff00">✔</p>
      var1 = “red”
      print(var1)
    </pre>

        <h4>Basic If-Then Statements:</h4>
        <p>An if-then statement can be arranged like this</p>

        <pre>      if var1 == var2:
      print(var1)
    </pre>

        <p>In this case, we would receive an error because we never defined a variable</p>

        <pre>      var1 = 1
      var2 = 1
      <br>
      if var1 == var2:
      print(var1)
    </pre>

        <p>Now we will see an output of “1” because 1 = 1 and we told the computer to print var1, which is 1</p>

        <h4>Variables:</h4>

        <p>There are many different data types</p>

        <p>The basics are: </p>

        <ul>

          <li>int, can store any number from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, but no decimals</li>
          <br>
          <li>float, any number between -3400000000000000000000000000 to 3400000000000000000000000000 with decimals</li>
          <br>
          <li>boolean, true or false</li>
          <br>
          <li>str, any text</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Variables that use numbers can be assigned in two ways</p>

        <p>var1 = var1 + 1</p>

        <p>var1 += 1</p>

        <p>Both of these ways do the same thing, they add one to var1</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="two articles">
        <h4>Inputs:</h4>

        <p>By default, Python can only accept one type of input without packages, and that is text. An input statement looks like this:</p>

        <p>TextInput = input(“Input: “)</p>

        <p>When you type anything in, it will essentially set the input to whatever you input in the computer's eyes. In most cases, you will be trying to get a number from an input, but an input will give a string. So, to use an input to receive a number from the user you must call the int() function like this:</p>

        <p>NumInput = int(input(“Input: “))</p>
