    <h3>The purpose of this website is to help a complete beginner learn how to code Python. The reason Python was chosen instead of a different language is because it is a very beginner language to learn. It is widely renowned for being able to import packages. Packages are installable files that add code to complete a generic task, some just add math functions or others that add sprites, physics or complete automation of keyboard and mouse functions.</h3>

<p>A basic tutorial with examples and helpful tips and tricks</p>
<p></p>
<p>Basic info:</p>
<p>I will be using Visual Studio Code by Microsoft to display code and other functions, you can download it “https://code.visualstudio.com/” here. I will also use comments to show where to put code, they are displayed by hashtags.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A start:</p>
<p>Many basic commands are required to be used to make anything functional, including if-then statements, input, variables, and knowledge of basic math.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Python reads all code from left to right, top to bottom, just like a human. So, what this means is that you must declare all variables before trying to use them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Basic If-Then Statements</p>
<pre>
<p style="color:red">X</p>
print(var1)        
var1 = “red”
<p style="color:green">✓</p>
var1 = “red”
print(var1)
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>An if-then statement can be arranged like this</p>
<p></p>
<pre>
if var1 == var2:
   print(var1)
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>In this case, we would receive an error because we never defined a variable</p>
<p></p>
<pre>
var1 = 1
var2 = 1
<p></p>
if var1 == var2:
    print(var1)
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>Now we will see an output of “1” because 1 = 1 and we told the computer to print var1, which is 1</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Variable</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are many different data types</p>
<p></p>
<p>The basics are: </p>
<p></p>
<p>    int, can store any number from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, but no decimals</p>
<p>    float, any number between -3400000000000000000000000000 to 3400000000000000000000000000 with decimals</p>
<p>    boolean, true or false</p>
<p>    str, any text</p>
<p></p>
<p>Variables that use numbers can be assigned in two ways</p>
<p>var1 = var1 + 1</p>
<p></p>
<p>var1 += 1</p>
<p></p>
<p>Both of these ways do the same thing, they add one to var1</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Inputs</p>
<p></p>
<p>By default, Python can only accept one type of input without packages, and that is text. An input statement looks like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>TextInput = input(“Input: “)</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you type anything in, it will essentially set the input to whatever you input in the computer's eyes. In most cases, you will be trying to get a number from an input, but an input will give a string. So, to use an input to receive a number from the user you must call the int() function like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>NumInput = int(input(“Input: “))</p>
